# Machine-Learning---QLearning
A Reinforcement learning example with Q-Learning

Assumption: You already understand the concept of Q-Learning

Given: A board-game-like data in file board.txt with size 10x10. Each coordinate has it own reward. The agent start on coordinate 1x1 and should reach coordinate 10x0. Agent should go to the 10x10 coordinate with maximum reward as much as he can get.

Goal: The agent reach the 10x10 coordinate from 1x1 coordinate and get the maximum reward. Once the maximum reward found, the best policy will created.

Hint:
1. The code will show the episode running, optimum policy and reward total
2. Read the Guide.txt to know what you can do with this code
